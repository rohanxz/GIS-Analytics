# **App Name**: Trip Canvas

## Core Features:

- Dynamic Trip Visualization: Dynamic content rendering across all four screens based on user-defined parameters, which should override hardcoded examples. Screen 1 provides a visual summary; screen 2 shows a detailed, categorized breakdown; screen 3 presents a geographical view with pinned locations; screen 4 offers a calendar view of scheduled activities.
- Effortless Screen Navigation: Intuitive navigation with buttons to switch between different screens (Summary, Breakdown, Map, Calendar). Navigation design will replicate image and enable effortless movement throughout app.
- AI-Powered Itinerary Enhancement: Generative AI tool provides suggestions to enrich a trip with suggested activities and landmarks. AI reviews itinerary for scheduling bottlenecks and suggests optimizations.
- Trip Summary Dashboard: Screen 1 shows an interactive Summary with key highlights and visuals of a user's saved trip, that serves as a dashboard or landing screen. This allows a high-level overview of important information.
- Categorized Trip Breakdown: The Breakdown Screen organizes activities and landmarks into categorized buckets, so users may view, for instance, upscale landmarks separately from more budget-friendly locations. Allows efficient decision making, according to a user's needs.
- Geographic Visualization: A geographic map displays key destinations in a dynamic fashion so a user may visualize locations across Istanbul. A user will intuitively derive co-location information across these points of interest, and consider routes and alternate stops along the way.
- Time-Aware Planning: Calendar provides a chronologically displayed timeline of planned stops along the way.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: HSL(200, 65%, 50%) -- A moderate blue (#2D9AD8) evokes calm and exploration, complementing travel themes.
- Background color: HSL(200, 15%, 95%) -- An off-white (#F0F7FA) provides a clean backdrop that doesn't distract from the visual elements.
- Accent color: HSL(170, 50%, 40%) -- A vibrant green (#3FB58A) highlights interactive elements and suggests discovery.
- Font: 'PT Sans' (sans-serif) for both headings and body text. Note: currently only Google Fonts are supported.
- Clean, minimalist icons to represent different categories and actions throughout the app.
- A clean, card-based layout promotes focus.
- Subtle transitions and animations on user interactions, such as loading dynamic content and navigating between screens.
